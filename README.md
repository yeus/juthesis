jupyterdocs
===========

This project helps in using jupyter notebooks (http://jupyter.org/) as a basis for large documetns like phd/master/bachelor-thesis, papers etc... 

inspiration for this project came from:
* http://blog.juliusschulz.de/blog/ultimate-ipython-notebook
* https://sylvaindeville.net/2015/07/17/writing-academic-papers-in-plain-text-with-markdown-and-jupyter-notebook/

in addition to that several script to make life easier were developed and a workflow to itnegrate this git project into your own
folder structure.
