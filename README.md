jupyterdocs
===========

This project helps in using jupyter notebooks (http://jupyter.org/) as a basis for large documents such as phd/master/bachelor-thesis, papers etc... 

inspiration for this project came from:
* http://blog.juliusschulz.de/blog/ultimate-ipython-notebook
* https://sylvaindeville.net/2015/07/17/writing-academic-papers-in-plain-text-with-markdown-and-jupyter-notebook/

In addition to that, several scripts to make life easier were developed and a workflow to integrate this git project into your own
folder structure.
